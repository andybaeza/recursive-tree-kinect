# Interactive Recursive Tree with Kinect

An **interactive generative visualization** that grows and transforms in response to human movement.  
Using a **Kinect sensor** and **Processing with Java** with the **SimpleOpenNI** library, this project creates a recursive tree whose **angle, color, and structure** react in real time to the position of the user’s hands.

## 🎨 Concept

This project explores the connection between **nature and human motion** through code.  
By turning body gestures into parameters that shape a digital tree, it seeks to visualize the idea of **organic growth** influenced by human interaction — where every movement gives life to a new form.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Processing with Java**
- **SimpleOpenNI library** for Kinect integration
- **Microsoft Kinect v1** sensor
- Recursive algorithms for tree generation

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The Kinect sensor detects the user’s **hand positions** in 3D space.  
2. The data is processed through **SimpleOpenNI** in Processing.  
3. The recursive tree algorithm generates branches whose:
   - **Angle** changes with horizontal hand position.
   - **Color** responds to vertical movement.
4. The result is a dynamic, evolving tree that mirrors your gestures in real time.
